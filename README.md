# Creator Lab

[![Watch Creator Lab classify Reel scripts and reveal hook patterns](docs/assets/creator-lab-demo.gif)](https://novitckii.com/lib/creator-lab/jev-demo.mp4)

**[Watch the full-quality demo](https://novitckii.com/lib/creator-lab/jev-demo.mp4)** · [Download MP4](docs/assets/creator-lab-demo.mp4) · Saved analysis replay

Turn a creator's Instagram Reels into a searchable research library. Filter by topic and hook, compare engagement, read the scripts, and open the original posts behind each pattern.

Built with **Apify → Fireworks or Groq → TypeSafe Jev via OpenRouter**. Runs locally in your browser. Bring your own API keys and choose a public creator, including your own account.

## Start here

**[Full setup guide](docs/SETUP.md)** covers installing the tools, getting keys, choosing a transcription provider, your first analysis, and troubleshooting.

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (24 recommended; minimum 22.9) and [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html). Both `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` must be on PATH.
2. Download this repository using **Code → Download ZIP**, unzip it, and open a terminal in that folder. Or clone it:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/artemnovitckii/creator-lab.git
   cd creator-lab
   ```

3. Create your local configuration:

   ```sh
   npm run setup
   ```

4. Open `.env` in your editor. Add `APIFY_TOKEN`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, and **one** transcription key: `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` or `GROQ_API_KEY`. Set `TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER` to match. No separate TypeSafe key is needed.
5. Check and launch:

   ```sh
   npm run doctor
   npm start
   ```

6. Open **http://127.0.0.1:5190**, verify **Connections**, then choose **New analysis**. Enter a username without `@`. Start with a 20-Reel pilot.

No npm dependencies or build step are needed. You can open the synthetic motion rehearsal without keys; real collection and analysis use paid provider APIs.

## What you get

- Eight transcript classifications: topic, opening move, hook mechanism, script structure, evidence, emotional appeal, advice specificity, and spoken CTA.
- Script passages labeled as hook, setup, problem, example, advice, payoff, CTA, or other, with source text and available timestamps.
- Combined topic and hook filters, engagement comparisons with sample sizes, and original-Reel links.
- A synchronized thumbnail wall and performance map, with saved-result replay for screen recording.
- Pausing, resuming, transcript reuse, classification caching, and JSON exports.

Jev sees the speech before performance metrics are joined. Views and plays remain separate. Unknown metrics stay unknown. Engagement comparisons describe the selected sample; they do not prove what caused a Reel to perform.

## Providers

| Stage | Provider | Configuration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Collect Reel metadata and media URLs | [Apify Instagram Reel Scraper](https://apify.com/apify/instagram-reel-scraper) | `APIFY_TOKEN` |
| Transcribe, default option | [Fireworks](https://fireworks.ai/) | `TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER=fireworks`, `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` |
| Transcribe, alternative | [Groq](https://console.groq.com/docs/speech-to-text) | `TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER=groq`, `GROQ_API_KEY` |
| Classify scripts | [TypeSafe Jev via OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/typesafe/jev-1.13/api) | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |

Use either transcription provider. There is no automatic switch that could charge a different provider. Restart the server after changing `.env`.

Classification calls OpenRouter's [System One API](https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/community/typesafe-sdk) with `model: typesafe/jev-1.13`, preserving Jev's typed choices, probabilities, and confidence scores. It does not use a chat model or Jev Router. For an existing setup, replace `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` with `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and supply an OpenRouter key; direct TypeSafe keys are no longer read.

## Costs and coverage

Apify and speech charges go to their respective accounts; Jev is billed through OpenRouter. The Apify spending cap in the form covers **Apify only**, not Jev or transcription. Start small and check provider billing before increasing the batch. Jev costs use OpenRouter's reported `usage.cost` when available, otherwise an estimate from input tokens. Displayed costs are not a complete billing guarantee.

Each run requests 1 to 1,000 Reels from one handle. Actual coverage depends on Instagram and Apify. The scraper skips pinned and trial Reels; this is not a guaranteed full-account archive. Private, deleted, expired, or inaccessible media may fail. Music-only and very short speech are excluded from script analysis.

Replay animates saved results. It does not run collection or inference again, and its playback speed is not the pipeline's processing speed.

## Privacy

The server binds to `127.0.0.1`. Keys stay in your local `.env` or server memory and are used to authenticate requests to their providers. Apify receives the handle; your chosen speech provider receives audio; OpenRouter receives transcript text and classification questions and routes them to TypeSafe Jev. Original source media is fetched from supported CDN hosts. The dashboard also loads fonts from Google Fonts. [Full data flow](docs/PRIVACY.md).

`.env`, generated data, caches, and downloaded media are excluded from Git. This repository includes no personal API keys or collected creator archive. Never put keys into a GitHub issue or share your `.env`.

## Development

```sh
npm run check
npm test
```

Tests use mocked provider responses and local FFmpeg fixtures; they do not make paid API calls. Jev key verification authenticates against OpenRouter's `/api/v1/key`; it does not run inference or guarantee credits or model access. A small live pilot is the final setup check.
